{"text":"Yes you can try different contact lenses. However it is always best to speak to your optician before doing so. Our resident optician, Benjamin has produced a 'Contact Lens Guide' to better inform our customers of compatible and upgrade lenses for all contact lenses. You can view the guide https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lens-guide","question":"Can I try different contact lenses?","origin":"lenses_q_a","action":"none","url  ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs  "}
{"text":"When you receive your contact lens prescription from your optician, you should be informed of the wearing pattern compatible with your lenses. The most common contact lenses are disposed of daily, or cleaned and stored overnight for wear over a two-week or monthly time period. Some contact lenses are designed for extended wear; this means they can be worn continuously for a certain time period. It is not advisable to wear your contact lenses continuously without consulting your optician first as not everyone's eyes are compatible with extended wear lenses.","question":"How long can I wear my contact lenses?","origin":"lenses_q_a","action":"none","url  ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs  "}
{"text":"Some contact lens wearers do suffer with dry and gritty eyes. Environmental factors such as air conditioning and heating, the position you sit in and the amount of water you drink can also affect your eyes. It could also be the contact lenses you are wearing. For example, Focus Dailies All Day Comfort (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/focus-dailies-all-day-comfort) lenses should not be worn for more than 8 hours a day. However, Acuvue Trueye (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/1-day-acuvue-trueye) can be worn for up to 16 hours a day as they are made from silicone hydrogel (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lenses/silicone-hydrogel-contact-lenses) which allows more oxygen to reach the eye. You can use artificial tear or eye drops (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/eye-care/eye-drops) as they are better known to help to rewet and moisturise the eye or you can talk to your optician about changing your lenses to suit your lifestyle.","question":"Are dry gritty eyes normal for contact lens wearers?","origin":"lenses_q_a","action":"upload","url  ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs  "}
{"text":"Yes some contact lenses can help to filter out damaging UVA and UVB light. Acuvue (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/brand/acuvue-contact-lenses) is the only brand where all its contact lenses have UV blocking technology. Other UV filtering lenses include: Avaira (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/avaira), Avaira Toric (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/avaira-toric), Avaira Toric (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/avaira-toric), Biomedics 55 Evolution (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/biomedics-55), Biomedics Toric (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/biomedics-toric), everclear UV (url: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/everclear-uv).

{"text":"On the product page for your contact lenses you will be asked to enter your prescription details. From left to right the different specifications mean: base curve (bc):the curvature of the lens in millimetres usually between 8.3 and 9.0. Diameter (d):the diameter of the contact lens. This number ranges from between 13.8 to 14.5. Power (pwr/sph):is a + or - figure followed by a number e. G. -4.50 or +0.25. This represents the level of visual correction needed, and whether your lenses correct long-sightedness (plus/+ powers) or short-sightedness (minus/- powers). For some contact lenses the power may also be 0.00, plano or displayed with this symbol  which is for non-prescription use e. G. Coloured contact lenses. If you have astigmatism the following values will also be required: cylinder (cyl):a minus number that increases on a scale of 0.50 dioptres, ranging between -0.75 to -2.75 in standard lenses. In bespoke xr contact lenses, the cylinder moves upwards to -5.75 in steps of 0.50. Axis (ax):a number between 0 and 180, that determines the direction needed to correct your astigmatism. It varies in a scale of 10 degrees on standard contact lenses and of 5 degrees on bespoke xr contact lenses. If you wear multifocal contact lenses the following values will also be required: addition (add):a + number between 0.50 and 3.00, or referred to as high, medium or low. This is an additional power that determines the level of correction needed for you to focus on near objects. Dominant (d):a choice between \"d\" and \"n\" to determine which is the dominant and the non-dominant eye. Please note: if only one option is given for any field, the lenses are only available with that option.","question":"What values do I enter in the prescription information fields?","origin":"lenses_q_a","action":"none","url  ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs  "}

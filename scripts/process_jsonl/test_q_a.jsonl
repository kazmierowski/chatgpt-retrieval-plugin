{"text":"Yes you can try different contact lenses. However it is always best to speak to your optician before doing so. Our resident optician, Benjamin has produced a 'Contact Lens Guide' to better inform our customers of compatible and upgrade lenses for all contact lenses.

{"text":"When you receive your contact lens prescription from your optician, you should be informed of the wearing pattern compatible with your lenses. The most common contact lenses are disposed of daily, or cleaned and stored overnight for wear over a two-week or monthly time period. Some contact lenses are designed for extended wear; this means they can be worn continuously for a certain time period. It is not advisable to wear your contact lenses continuously without consulting your optician first as not everyone's eyes are compatible with extended wear lenses.","question":"How long can I wear my contact lenses?","custom_metadata":"{\"question\": \"How long can I wear my contact lenses?\"}","source":"chat","namespace":"Lenses_q_a","url ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs "}
{"text":"Some contact lens wearers do suffer with dry and gritty eyes. Environmental factors such as air conditioning and heating, the position you sit in and the amount of water you drink can also affect your eyes. It could also be the contact lenses you are wearing. For example, Focus Dailies All Day Comfort (link: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/focus-dailies-all-day-comfort) lenses should not be worn for more than 8 hours a day. However, Acuvue Trueye (link: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/1-day-acuvue-trueye) can be worn for up to 16 hours a day as they are made from silicone hydrogel (link: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lenses/silicone-hydrogel-contact-lenses) which allows more oxygen to reach the eye. You can use artificial tear or eye drops (link: https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/eye-care/eye-drops) as they are better known to help to rewet and moisturise the eye or you can talk to your optician about changing your lenses to suit your lifestyle.","question":"Are dry gritty eyes normal for contact lens wearers?","custom_metadata":"{\"question\": \"Are dry gritty eyes normal for contact lens wearers?\"}","source":"chat","namespace":"Lenses_q_a","url ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs "}

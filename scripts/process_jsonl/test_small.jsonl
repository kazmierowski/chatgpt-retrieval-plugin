{"text":"Yes you can try different contact lenses. However it is always best to speak to your optician before doing so. Our resident optician, Benjamin has produced a 'Contact Lens Guide' to better inform our customers of compatible and upgrade lenses for all contact lenses.

{"text":"When you receive your contact lens prescription from your optician, you should be informed of the wearing pattern compatible with your lenses. The most common contact lenses are disposed of daily, or cleaned and stored overnight for wear over a two-week or monthly time period. Some contact lenses are designed for extended wear; this means they can be worn continuously for a certain time period. It is not advisable to wear your contact lenses continuously without consulting your optician first as not everyone's eyes are compatible with extended wear lenses.","question":"How long can I wear my contact lenses?","origin":"lenses_q_a","namespace":"Lenses_q_a","action":"upload","url  ":"https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/faqs  "}
